# E07a-Particles


This was a cool excercise to get us familiar with giving behaviors and traits to sprites. Based on what the particles were already doing I wanted to rain or fire but since the particles already shoot up then fall I choose fire and changed the color scheme to be red, orange, and yellow and changed the image to be flame_3.
